Today, I worked on:

- Getting Docker up and running
- Getting an Invoice model written out

Using a combination of resources I was able to successfully get docker running and syncd up to the atlas cloud db.

It was a reminder that docker is a wild and crazy place. We need to have docker running local volumes on each of our machines, as well as a SHARED db connection to the atlas cloud.

Then I moved onto the Invoice model and was reminded that FastAPI and pydantic are new and exciting frontiers. Giddyupppppppp
