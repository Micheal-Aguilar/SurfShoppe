Debating how to handle the User. At first I thought of doing it as a microservice, but I think I am unnecessarily complicating things for this project if I want to protect the endpoints in the monolith.

# 11/15

Spent some time exploring Auth0. Ran into a few problems that were taking too long

# 11/20

Worked on React setup, basic folder structure and the routes for all the pages

# 11/21

Today I will create the landing page and the style wrapper for the entire project. If I finish that before noon, I will code out the user list page
