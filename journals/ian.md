Today, I worked on:

- Writing out CRUD routes for Invoices and Orders

This is going to be a touch and go situation, as we are working purely from the docs, and have no previous experience with pyMongo.

Today, I worked on:

- Getting Docker up and running
- Getting an Invoice model written out

Using a combination of resources I was able to successfully get docker running and syncd up to the Atlas cloud db.

It was a reminder that docker is a wild and crazy place. We need to have docker running local volumes on each of our machines, as well as a SHARED db connection to the Atlas cloud.

Then I moved onto the Invoice model and was reminded that FastAPI, Pydantic, and PyMongo are new to this project. Giddyupppppppp
